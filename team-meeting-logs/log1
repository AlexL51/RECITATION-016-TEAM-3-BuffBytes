Team Meeting with Nikita #1:

Going over the pure requirements; need all stuff listed in the project guide.

3 commits per week per person. Commit early, commit often (but not too often).

Everyone needs to work weekly and not tied to the lab we have on Friday. The schedule will revolve around our Tuesday meetings with Nikita.

We need release notes.

We need to fill the project board.
- IE Register Page: EJS page, register API, and the database to insert into. User story: as I user, I will enter my details and I will be navigated to login if succesful.
  - For backend: user stories are assumed that the user knows how our program works (ie: be able to insert my post into a database)
- Register will be broken down into front end and back end epics
