Meeting With Nikita
*Have skeleton with working: profile, home, login, register, topic post
*What to focus on: things that have the most value for the user.
*The nested comments, which would be one of our hardest tasks, should be put aside for later. Prioritize map ahead of this
*Even though map would be great, focus on the forum portion first. Top Priority: All working elements of forum with all current stuff plus: regular post comments, frontend design, user history



Plans for Next Week:
*Finish all skeleton and backend stuff
*Continue to make everything look really pretty with smooth UI
*Implement Google Maps API
