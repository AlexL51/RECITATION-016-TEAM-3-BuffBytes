Nikita 2nd Meeting: 
What we have finished: rudimentary login and register page.
What we should focus on: getting database set up and a home page with posts.

Notes:
Focus primarily on what is needed (ie the project requirements) and save more granular stuff until the end (ie profile page)
Continue to make committs.
Go to office hours if need assistance, especially with the bigger tasks.
