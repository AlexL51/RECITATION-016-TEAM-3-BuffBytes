# RECITATION-016-TEAM-3-BuffBytes

An accessible web forum for CU students. This app would replace the disarrayed constellation of club Discords, Piazza posts, and Canvas forum posts with a united space for CU students to socialize, coordinate meetings, and discuss academics. Verified professors and staff members can answer questions and provide clarifications.
